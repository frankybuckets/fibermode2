    "- p: refers to the number of sides of the polygonal lattice.  For a hexagonal lattice we use p=6.\n",
    "- layers: refers to the number of layers of tubes.  For (a) there are a total of 7 layers.\n",
    "- skip: indicates number of layers of tubes to be skipped to make the core region.  For (a) we skip 1 layer, while for (b) we skip 2.\n",
    "- sep: Identical to $\\Lambda$ above; indicates the distance separating layers of tubes\n",
    "- r_tube: the radius of the tubes, equal to d/2 where d appears above.\n",
    "- r_core: radius of the core region.  This is the area inside the lattice formed by skipping layers.\n",
    "- r_fiber: The radius of the fiber as a whole.  More generally this can be any radius after which refractive profile is homogeneous.\n",
    "- scale: factor by which to scale the fiber parameters to make a non-dimensional geometry.  Frequently chosen to make the core region unit radius.\n",
    "- n_tube, n_clad: the refractive indices of the tube and cladding material respectively.\n",
    "- n_core, n_buffer, n_outer: the refractive index present in the respective regions.  We will often have n_core the same as n_clad as it is frequently a subregion of the cladding.  The index n_outer must be the same as n_buffer as these appear in the homogeous region.\n",
    "- n0 : Base refractive index used in the refractive index function V.  Must be same as n_outer and n_buffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mesh Parameters:\n",
    "- t_buffer, t_outer: desired thickness of the buffer and PML regions respectively.\n",
    "- alpha: PML parameter.\n",
    "- pml_, air_, tube_, clad_, core_ maxh: maximum element diameter for mesh on respective regions."
